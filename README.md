# Swing-Life-Away
<p>Simple animation for the Codepen challenge "Swing," which happened in the third week of May. I also played around with typographic effects I hadn't tried before, like text shadows to make the text look more 3-d. Currently, this animation isn't mobile responsive, and it looks best on a laptop or desktop screen. If I were to make the animation responsive, I'd have to change the font and the text to look better at smaller sizes.</p>
<p> You can see this animation on Codepen <a href="https://codepen.io/TurtleQueenCoding/full/VwQQMGr">here</a>.</p>
